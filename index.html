  <p><em><strong>Nature</strong></em>, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.
     <b><em>"Nature!"</em></b> can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
     The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature,
     human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
     The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura, 
     or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".[2]
      In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), 
      which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the 
      world develop of their own accord.[3][4] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one 
      of several expansions of the original notion;[1] it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις 
      by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), 
      and has steadily gained currency ever since. During the advent of modern scientific method in the last 
      several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[5][6] 
      With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived 
      from intentional intervention : it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, 
      American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx). 
      However, a vitalist vision of nature, closer to the presocratic one, got reborn at the same time,
      especially after Charles Darwin.[1]</p>

     <h2>Earth :</h2>
     <p><em>Earth is the only planet known to support life,</em> 
     and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the solar system, 
     it is third closest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. 
     Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate
     zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.[7] Precipitation varies widely with location,
     from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is 
     covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited 
     land in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
     <h2>Atmosphere, Climate, Weather:</h2>
     <p> The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops
     the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller 
     amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. 
     The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. 
     The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.
     </p>
     <h2>Water on Earth:</h2>
     <p>Water is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O) and is vital for 
     all known forms of life.[29] In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, 
     but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. 
     Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface.[30] On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large bodies 
     of water, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% in the air as vapor, clouds, 
     and precipitation.[31][32] Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, 
     and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, 
     a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and 
     manufactured products.</p>
